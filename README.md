# Painting-Manager
This is a solution for keeping track of paintings. This project grew out of me trying to make a little extra money selling some of my landscape oil paintings. For management, 
I was trying to literally glue small pictures of my paintings into a spiral notebook and write down the dates I painted them, what size they were, and how much I wanted to charge for them, etc. Eventually, I lost interest in actually making any real money out of my paintings but I still wanted a way to keep track of them and have an ordered gallery of my paintings, but have the details of my paintings. I didn't want to have to write the dates/sizes on top of images of my paintings! So, I spent the greater part of a summer building this desktop application to do the job.

The most prominent (and useful) feature is the gallery, which allows you to view paintings by filtering. Additionally, you can see the details of a painting, such as its size, painting type, and what categories it is in.

Other useful features include the Notes section, which allows me to note down things quickly that I used to scribble down on pieces of scrap paper all over my desk.

At current, the project is *mostly* finished. The main thing that doesn't feel quite complete to me is the user interface. I feel the UI is a little sloppy (the gallery in particular) and could use a reworking to make it much more cleaner and modern. I had that in mind while building it, but was also categorizing and putting dates to my paintings while building it, and ran out of time to work any more on it!

For those interested in building off of this for C#/WPF purposes, feel free to clone it and use it, or if you have your own artwork you would like to categorize, go for it! However, the project, in its current status, is a Visual Studio Project--it's not an installable software (not yet anyway).
